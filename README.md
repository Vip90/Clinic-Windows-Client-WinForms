# Clinic-Windows-Client-WinForms
Application Clinic is used to manage the reception work at the clinic : for adding patients, doctors and visits and managing them.
The idea for creating application comes from time when i used to going to allergy clinic and there wasnt any software to keeping records of visits so the lady at the reception desk had to write everything in a notebook. Unfortunately in those days I couldn't do programs so I leave it until 2020. I want create full system which will include WEB client in  ASP.NET Core, desktop client in WPF and maybe client for Android. Now it's application using WinForms with basic operations : adding and removing patients, doctors and visits. Database was created by Entity Framework in MS SQL.
